Just for practicing. The to do list is hosted at https://todolist-cbqr.onrender.com/.

You could choose to two modes, one is `Today` to-do-list, the other are `to-do-list` for any other subcategories which you want, by specifying the path of subcategory.
Whenever you could traverse a subcategory path, it will create a to-do-list for that specified category.
